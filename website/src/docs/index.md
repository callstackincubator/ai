# Introduction

react-native-ai brings on-device AI to React Native apps, allowing you to run large language models directly on users' devices.

## Why On-Device AI?

- **Privacy:** All processing happens locallyâ€”no data leaves the device
- **Speed:** Instant responses without network latency  
- **Offline:** Works anywhere, even without internet

## What's Supported

**MLC LLM Engine:** Run popular models like Mistral, Llama, and Phi with our MLC-powered package. Compatible with Vercel AI SDK for easy integration.

**Apple Intelligence:** Native support for Apple's on-device foundation models with `@react-native-ai/apple`, featuring purpose-built mobile architecture and dynamic adapters.

Both packages offer streaming and a unified API that works across iOS and Android.
