# Demo Audio File

This file serves as a placeholder for a demo audio file containing a Harvard sentence.

The Harvard sentences are a collection of 720 sample phrases that are phonetically balanced sentences, often used for testing speech recognition and audio equipment.

Example Harvard sentence: "The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks."

To use this demo:
1. Replace this file with an actual audio file (e.g., `demo-harvard-sentence.m4a` or `demo-harvard-sentence.wav`)
2. Record or find an audio file containing a Harvard sentence
3. The audio file should be clear and contain a single sentence for best transcription results

For production use, add an actual audio file here with the same base name but proper audio extension.
