:::info

The command is started through the React Native Community CLI's `start` command, which is overridden [inside `react-native.config.js`](/) to spawn Re.Pack's dev server.

:::

:::warning This plugin is primarily intended for Rspack users.

The main purpose of this plugin is to limit the **build performance impact** of the `react-native-reanimated` babel plugin.

If you're using webpack with `babel-loader`, you probably don't need this plugin. Instead, you should follow the [official Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#step-2-add-reanimateds-babel-plugin) and add the Reanimated Babel plugin directly to your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ["module:@react-native/babel-preset"],
  plugins: ["react-native-reanimated/plugin"],
};
```

:::danger Platform-Specific Output
By default, extracted asset files are copied to `assets/` directory for iOS and `drawable-*` directories (e.g. `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`, etc.) for Android which matches Metro's asset handling behavior.
