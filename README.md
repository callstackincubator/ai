# react-native-ai

Run LLMs locally in React Native app via Universal [MLC LLM Engine](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) with compatibility for [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/).

## Installation

#### 1. Install the package

```
npm install react-native-ai
```

#### 2. Clone MLC LLM Engine repository and set environment variable.

```
git clone https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm
cd mlc-llm
git submodule update --init --recursive
MLC_LLM_SOURCE_DIR=$(pwd) // Add this to your environment variables e.g. in .zshrc
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that `mlc_llm` works and `MLC_LLM_SOURCE_DIR` is set in your environment variables.

#### 3. Install `mlc_llm` CLI:

To install `mlc_llm` CLI, please follow steps described [in the official guide](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/install/mlc_llm.html).

To ensure that CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:

```
mlc_llm
```

If you see any output then it means that CLI is installed correctly.

#### 4. Add `mlc-config.json` with models and other properties to root directory of your project:

```js
{
  "iphone": [
    {
      "model": "MODEL_NAME",
      "model_id": "MODEL_ID",
      // "estimated_vram_bytes": 3043000000
    }
  ],
  "android": [
    {
      "model": "MODEL_NAME",
      "model_id": "MODEL_ID",
      // "estimated_vram_bytes": 3043000000
    }
  ]
}
```

Read more about configuration for [Android](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/android.html#customize-the-app) and for [iOS](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/ios.html#customize-the-app).

You can also check out [example config](https://github.com/callstackincubator/ai/blob/main/example/mlc-config.json) in the repository.

#### 4. **[Android only]**

If you want to execute models also on Android you need to set `ANDROID_NDK` and `TVM_NDK_CC` environment variables. Everything is described in [MLC LLM docs](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/android.html#id2).

#### 5. **[iOS only]** If you want to execute models also on iOS you need to:

- Add "Increased Memory Limit" capability inside your Xcode project inside Signing & Capabilities tab.

- Install Cocoapods:
  ```
  cd ios && pod install
  ```

#### 6. Run the following command to prepare binaries and static libraries for the project

```
npx react-native-ai mlc-prepare
```

#### 7. Add missing polyfills

To make the Vercel AI SDK work in your project, you should include polyfills by first installing these pacakges:

```
npm install @azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill @ungap/structured-clone web-streams-polyfill text-encoding
```

and creating `polyfills.ts` file which will contain following imports:

```js
import '@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill';
import structuredClone from '@ungap/structured-clone';
import { polyfillGlobal } from 'react-native/Libraries/Utilities/PolyfillFunctions';

const webStreamPolyfills = require('web-streams-polyfill/ponyfill/es6');

polyfillGlobal('TextEncoder', () => require('text-encoding').TextEncoder);
polyfillGlobal('ReadableStream', () => webStreamPolyfills.ReadableStream);
polyfillGlobal('TransformStream', () => webStreamPolyfills.TransformStream);
polyfillGlobal('WritableStream', () => webStreamPolyfills.WritableStream);
polyfillGlobal('TextEncoderStream', () => webStreamPolyfills.TextEncoderStream);
polyfillGlobal('structuredClone', () => structuredClone);
```

Make sure to include them inside `index.js` before registering the root component.
