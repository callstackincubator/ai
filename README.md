# React Native AI

A collection of on-device AI primitives for React Native with first-class Vercel AI SDK support. Run AI models directly on users' devices for privacy-preserving, low-latency inference without server costs.

## Features

- üöÄ **Instant AI** - Use built-in system models immediately without downloads
- üîí **Privacy-first** - All processing happens on-device, data stays local
- üéØ **Vercel AI SDK compatible** - Drop-in replacement with familiar APIs
- üé® **Complete toolkit** - Text generation, embeddings, transcription, speech synthesis

## Available Providers

### Apple

Native integration with Apple's on-device AI capabilities:

- **Text Generation** - Apple Foundation Models for chat and completion
- **Embeddings** - NLContextualEmbedding for 512-dimensional semantic vectors
- **Transcription** - SpeechAnalyzer for fast, accurate speech-to-text
- **Speech Synthesis** - AVSpeechSynthesizer for natural text-to-speech with system voices

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @react-native-ai/apple
```

No additional linking needed, works immediately on iOS devices (autolinked).

#### Usage

```typescript
import { apple } from '@react-native-ai/apple'
import { 
  generateText,
  embed, 
  experimental_transcribe as transcribe, 
  experimental_generateSpeech as speech 
} from 'ai'

// Text generation with Apple Intelligence
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: apple(),
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing'
})

// Generate embeddings
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: apple.textEmbeddingModel(),
  value: 'Hello world'
})

// Transcribe audio
const { text } = await transcribe({
  model: apple.transcriptionModel(),
  audio: audioBuffer
})

// Text-to-speech
const { audio } = await speech({
  model: apple.speechModel(),
  text: 'Hello from Apple!'
})
```

#### Availability

| Feature | iOS Version | Additional Requirements |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Text Generation | iOS 26+ | Apple Intelligence device |
| Embeddings | iOS 17+ | - |
| Transcription | iOS 26+ | - |
| Speech Synthesis | iOS 13+ | iOS 17+ for Personal Voice |

See the [Apple documentation](https://react-native-ai.dev/docs/apple/getting-started) for detailed setup and usage guides.

### MLC Engine (Experimental)

Run popular open-source LLMs directly on-device using MLC's optimized runtime.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @react-native-ai/mlc
```

Requires the "Increased Memory Limit" capability in Xcode. See the [getting started guide](https://react-native-ai.dev/docs/mlc/getting-started) for setup instructions.

#### Usage

```typescript
import { mlc } from '@react-native-ai/mlc'
import { generateText } from 'ai'

// Create model instance
const model = mlc.languageModel('Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct')

// Download and prepare model (one-time setup)
await model.download()
await model.prepare()

// Generate response with Llama via MLC engine
const { text } = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt: 'Explain quantum computing'
})
```

#### Available Models

| Model ID | Size |
|----------|------|
| `Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` | ~2GB |
| `Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct` | ~2.5GB |
| `Mistral-7B-Instruct` | ~4.5GB |
| `Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` | ~1GB |

> [!NOTE]
> MLC requires iOS devices with sufficient memory (1-8GB depending on model). The prebuilt runtime supports the models listed above. For other models or custom configurations, you'll need to recompile the MLC runtime from source.

### Google (Coming Soon)

Support for Google's on-device models is planned for future releases.
